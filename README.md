# WoodBlockToys-back
## JAVA formation final exam


This is the final exam from my JAVA formation.

We had to create a REST API with Spring to generate barrels of wood blocks.

**Wood blocks were randomly generated with those parameters :**

* shape (square, triangular, hex, rectangular, cylindrical)
* volume (between 10 and 30 cm3)
* height (1, 4, 7 cm)
* wood essence type (oak, pine, beech, mahogany)
* finish (raw, satiny, matte, shiny)
* color (blue, white, red, yellow, orange, green, black)
